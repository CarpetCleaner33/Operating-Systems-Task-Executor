# Operating-Systems-Task-Executor
Task Executor Project for Operating System Concepts (CE 4348)

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to have teams implement the multithreaded synchronization
needed to implement the TaskExecutor service.

The secondary goal of the project (but the most difficult) is to implement a Fixed-Length
Blocking FIFO described in the textbook, and in class, using only Javaâ€™s Object wait() and
notify() in synchronized blocks. Note Synchronized blocks are acceptable, even needed to 
implement the bounded buffer. Do not use Semaphore or Synchronized methods to implement
the FIFO.
