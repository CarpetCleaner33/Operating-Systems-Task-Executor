# Operating-Systems-Task-Executor
Task Executor Project for Operating System Concepts (CE 4348)

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to have teams implement the multithreaded synchronization
needed to implement the TaskExecutor service.

Blocking FIFO described in the textbook, and in class, using only Javaâ€™s Object wait() and
notify() in synchronized blocks.
